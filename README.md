## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is my submission of the course project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.

In this repository, I have added the following four files:

1. "tidyData.txt" - contains the clean, processed dataset.
2. "run_analysis.R" - performs all the necessary operations to convert the raw dataset into a tidy dataset.
3. "Codebook.md" - indicates all the variables and summaries collected.
4. "README.md" - explains the analysis files, you are reading me right now!
